# FaceVideoAnalysis
## Using Computer Vision to Analyze Student Videos

* Stage 1 - Video preprocessing into smaller units and feature extraction using OpenFace 

* Stage 2 - Binary classification using random forests

* Stage 3 - Fine Tuning a pretrained VGGFace model for classifying personality traits in the ChaLearn dataset. Change to student video dataset. Will use this as a feature extractor to compare with stage 2 model. One or both of stage 2 and 3 results could be used as a baseline

* Stage 4 - Fine Tuning a pretrained 3D CNN models for the student dataset
